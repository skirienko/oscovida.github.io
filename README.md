# oscovida.github.io

This is the repository which hosts and builds the oscovida website.

If you want to avoid downloading the entire (pretty large) website source
with its history then you can check out just this branch by doing:

```
git clone git@github.com:oscovida/oscovida.github.io.git --branch main --single-branch
```
